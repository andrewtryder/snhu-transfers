# snhu-transfers

This is a small app deployed on Vercel that displays a list of the courses SNHU will transfer in, sorted by the classes themselves.

There are a number of other listings out there, including the official SNHU one, but it lists by the body and not the class. This makes it much more challenging to find.

Written in Python. Feel free to fork if you'd like to style it and make it better. The code is in templates and css in static.
